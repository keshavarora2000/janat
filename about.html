                United Christian Church of India was instituted in 1975 with a sole aim of enhancing
                the quality of living and social upliftment of the economically downtrodden. Right from
                the inception our founder Late Mr. Samuel Wilson was definite that education would
                be a key contributor to the path envisioned by UCCI
            </p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                <i>
                    “Right learning creates an array of opportunities enabling individuals
                    to economically independent”
                </i>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                UCCI thereafter under the leadership of Mr. John Wilson has been toiling rigorously to
                establish such an environment. Education over a period of time has becoming a
                flourishing business and the exorbitant fees charged by such organizations have been
                huge deterrent in enhancing the literacy of lower income groups – UCCI is determined
                to break this barrier and make education affordable even to poorest of the poor.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Over the past couple of decades UCCI has been successful in establishing 6 such
                schools and 3 colleges in and around Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, where children
                from underprivileged and subjugated classes are being provided an environment to
                enrich their physical, intellectual and moral well-being.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Furthermore, UCCI has initiated career oriented leaning programs primarily in field of
                healthcare – imparting paramedical knowledge and helping scores of youngsters
                achieve financial independence and a secure future for themselves and their families.
